      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a Computer Science and Technology student at Tecnológico de Monterrey
        (ITESM) with hands-on experience in software development, backend systems,
        web applications, mobile development and game development.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have worked in real-world projects including a WhatsApp chatbot for
        "Justicia Ciudadana A.C", a mobile app for waste collection management,
        a donation inventory web system using React, Docker and Django, and POS
        software development with Java and MySQL as part of my internships.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy learning new technologies, working in collaborative environments
        and developing solutions that create real value for users and organizations.
