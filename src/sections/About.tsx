        About Me
      </h2>

      <p style={{ maxWidth: "800px", fontSize: "1.1rem", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        I am a Computer Science and Technology student at Tecnológico de Monterrey
        (ITESM) with hands-on experience in software development, backend systems,
        web applications, mobile development and game development.  
        <br /><br />
        I have worked in real-world projects including a WhatsApp chatbot for 
        “Justicia Ciudadana A.C”, a mobile app for waste collection management, 
        a donation inventory web system using React, Docker and Django, and 
        POS software development with Java and MySQL as part of my internships.
        <br /><br />
        I enjoy learning new technologies, working in collaborative environments 
        and developing solutions that create real value for users and organizations.
